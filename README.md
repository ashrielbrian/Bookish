#  Bookish
Bookish is a simple app to search for book reviews on The New York Times, get the latest reviews on GoodReads, and pen your thoughts on the books you've read.

## Features
1. Search for book reviews by _The New York Times_ on the **Search** page.
    - Results of the search are presented in a Table View. Upon selecting any one of these results, you will be redirected to the original _NYT_ article.
2. The app's **Discover** page automatically retrieves the most recent reviews uploaded on _GoodReads_.
    - Results of the search are presented in a Table View. Upon selecting any one of these results, you will be redirected to the original _GoodReads_ review.
3. You can write down your thoughts on a book you've read by going on **My Books**.
    - Selecting the **+** on the top right will bring up the editor screen. To save a book review, you will need to enter a _title_, _author's name_, and the _review_ itself.
    - Click _save_ at the bottom of the screen to save the review onto your Device.
    - You can access your reviews back on the **My Books** tab.
    - You can delete your reviews by swiping left on the Table View, and tapping _Delete_. Beware - there is no recourse to this action!
    - For now, there will be no function to sync data to your other devices, or upload on GoodReads. This is a future feature I'd like to add.
